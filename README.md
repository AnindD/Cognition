**Why Build It?** There are few bots related to helping schoolwork and homework. Therefore, the goal of this project was to fill the gap ourselves and automate/efficiently organize the way we study. 

**Motivation:** The primary motivation of this project was to improve our knowledge of Python and working with the Discord API. This is the first "major"/large-scale propject I have worked on thus far.
