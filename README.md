# Mike and Anindit's Discord Bot 
**Project Summary:** Created a Discord bot geared towards helping students (particularly our age) with their academics and other tasks related to school. Features are: <br />
* Numerous tools to help students with their homework (i.e. quadratics solver, system of equations solver, unit conversions in chemistry and physics, etc.).
* Physics and math problem generators for students to practice on and prepare for tests. 
* Moderator commands to regulate chatrooms and Discord servers. 

**Why Build It?** There are few bots related to helping schoolwork and homework. Therefore, the goal of this project was to fill the gap ourselves and automate/efficiently organize the way we study. 

**Motivation:** The primary motivation of this project was to improve our knowledge of Python and working with the Discord API. This is the first "major"/large-scale propject I have worked on thus far.
