# Mike and Anindit's Discord Bot 
Small coding project where we created a discord bot on Python with the help of the Discord API Manuel and Discord.py library (all resources will be posted below). Project was done on Replit IDE. 

*Please note, some of this code is quite inefficient and sometimes it may be updated. I will only update the github file probably once every week or so.
